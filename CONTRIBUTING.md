# Contribution

If you want to contribute to the development of the bot you can do so in the following ways:
- **Create a new [issue](https://github.com/stamdiscord/GamerBot2.0/issues):** This is used to notify others that you've found a bug that needs to be fixed or that you want a new feature.
- **Make a [Pull Request](https://github.com/stamdiscord/GamerBot2.0/pulls):** Make Pull Requests with small changes. Try to only face one issue at a time.
  
  Please make sure to set **staging** branch as base when creating you pull request

## Formatting
For this bot, we like to format all the documents with tabs and **NOT** two spaces (which is the standard for javascript). Other than that, check that your code generally matches our coding style in terms of formatting before submitting your Pull Request.
